1) Overview:
- Multi-Client Chat App is a secure and scalable chat application that enables real-time communication between multiple users. It utilizes a hybrid encryption framework combining RSA and Fernet cryptographic techniques to ensure message confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. The application employs SSL/TLS protocols to protect client-server interactions and prevent unauthorized access.
2) Features:
- End-to-End Encryption: Messages are securely encrypted before transmission.
- Hybrid Cryptography: Uses RSA for key exchanges and symmetric encryption for messages.
- Multi-Client Support: Handles multiple user connections simultaneously.
- SSL/TLS Security: Ensures secure client-server communication.
3) Scalable Architecture:
- Efficient handling of numerous concurrent connections.
4) Robust Authentication:
- Encryption-based authentication to verify users.
5) Technologies Used:
- Python
- Socket Programming
- RSA & Fernet Cryptography (Python's cryptography library)
- SSL/TLS Protocols
- Multi-threading for concurrent connections
